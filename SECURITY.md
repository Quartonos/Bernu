## Malware
If you want to alert Malware Vulnerabilies, Don't wait
and alert it in "Issues". **BUT** please don't except i can fix
everything and also python code vulnerabilites. The only method to protect yourself from
Python vulnerabilites: Update your MicroPython firmware and do not type **PY** if somebody told so. 
If is not me :)
